                <p>The Pet Chef Delivered story began better than 3 years ago with our puppy.  
                He is the sweetest thing; with the longest list of food allergies, you could imagine.  
                Four pages of them, in fact.  So many, there was not a single dog food on the market 
                he could eat without triggering a reaction.  It was scary and overwhelming to think 
                that there was not a single dog food he could eat.
                </p>

                <p>It took a serious commitment, but after countless hours of research into dog nutrition, 
                    analysis of his allergy test results and recipe testing and development we can 
                    finally rest easily and feed our guy a menu we know is good for his health.  We have
                    a handle on how to determine the foods a pet might be allergic to.  We know how to 
                    write a nutritious recipe that accounts for all nutrients a pet needs.  We have refined 
                    a cooking process that allows for each batch to be developed without fear of cross 
                    contamination with allergic ingredients. 
                </p>

                    <u>Your pet might need a custom diet if</u>: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are licking or biting themselves (typically paws) </li>
                        <li>They are itchy and scratching themselves </li>
                        <li>They have hot spots </li>

            <blockquote>“I haven’t seen Miley happier than he has been since his allergies are now under control.  
                He is not itching anymore, and we all sleep peacefully now.  I can’t thank Pet Chef enough for 
                helping us all”. —Lindsay 
            </blockquote> 
                <br><br>
            <blockquote>“It was so luck that we found Pet Chef because we felt like we looked high and low for a food 
                that Barney could eat.  We were scared he might die.  Now he’s eating like he should and getting 
                good quality food.  We couldn’t be happier!”—Elizabeth and Don 
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                “Buck is a part of our family and he gets the best we can provide for him.  We now know that he needs a particular diet.  He’s happy and heathy and we are so thankful.” —Fred
